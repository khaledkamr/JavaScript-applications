# JavaScript Applications

Welcome to my repository of JavaScript applications! This collection includes various mini-projects that I developed while studying JavaScript. Each project is designed to demonstrate different concepts and techniques in JavaScript programming.

## Projects

Here are some of the projects included in this repository:

### 1. **Counter program**
   - A simple program that increment and decrement a number using buttons

### 2. **Dice roller**
   - An application that simulates rolling a dice, generating random dice values.

### 3. **Number guessing**
   - A game where the user guesses a number and receives feedback on their guess.

### 4. **Temperature conversion**
   - A tool to convert temperatures between different units (Celsius, Fahrenheit).

### 5. **Calculator**  
   - A basic calculator that performs arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

### 6. **Task list**  
   - An application to add, delete, and manage tasks, functioning as a simple to-do list. It uses local storage to retain the tasks even after refreshing or reopening the browser.
