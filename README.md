# JavaScript Applications

Welcome to my repository of JavaScript applications! This collection includes various mini-projects that I developed while studying JavaScript. Each project is designed to demonstrate different concepts and techniques in JavaScript programming.

## About

This repository contains a series of mini-projects built with JavaScript. Each project is intended to highlight different aspects of JavaScript, from basic syntax and DOM manipulation to more complex features such as APIs and asynchronous programming.

1. **Project 1: Counter program**
   - A simple calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations.
