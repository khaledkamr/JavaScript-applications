# JavaScript Applications

Welcome to my repository of JavaScript applications! This collection includes various mini-projects that I developed while studying JavaScript. Each project is designed to demonstrate different concepts and techniques in JavaScript programming.

## About

This repository contains a series of mini-projects built with JavaScript. Each project is intended to highlight different aspects of JavaScript, from basic syntax and DOM manipulation to more complex features such as APIs and asynchronous programming.

## Projects

Here are some of the projects included in this repository:

1. **Project 1: Counter program**
   - A simple program that increment and decrement a number using buttons
2. **Project 2: Dice roller**
   - An application that simulates rolling a dice, generating random dice values.
3. **Project 3: Number guessing**
   - A game where the user guesses a number and receives feedback on their guess.
4. **Project 4: Temperature conversion**
   - A tool to convert temperatures between different units (Celsius, Fahrenheit).
